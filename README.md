# Windows: Moving files into alphabetical folders
For whatever reason, it’s nearly impossible to search up (as my kids would say) simple instructions on a task I commonly find myself doing – moving a bunch of similar files into alphabetical folders. For example, all MP3 files that start with A should be moved into a child folder named A, all files that start with B should be moved into folder B, and so forth.

This script should do the trick. Change the two instances of .mp3 to whatever extension you like, or .* for all files
